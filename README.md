# Python based vulnerability scanner
Description: Create a Python-based vulnerability scanner that identifies weaknesses in the software code written by programmers. It can check for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and insecure configurations. You can also include an auto-patching feature to mitigate vulnerabilities as soon as they are found.

Python Libraries:
SQLMap: For automating SQL injection discovery.
OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): Python can interact with ZAP for penetration testing.
Nmap + Python-Nmap: To scan for network vulnerabilities.
Paramiko: To interact with SSH and check for misconfigurations on servers.
